# Verbs / Infinitives

We've seen verbs used like *yedim* or *'içerim'* -- but they are all modifiers off of the infinitives. 

## When a verb is used on its own, such as in a dictionary, it has the suffix *mek* or *mak*

Going back to our example, we can intuit that the root of *yedim*, or **i  ate** is *yemek* - and the root of *içerim*, or **i drink** is *içmek*
