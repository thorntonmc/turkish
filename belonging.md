# Belonging To You

*senin* is your. Like many times in Turkish, we need to change the ending of the noun when we 
make it belong.


senin baba*n*
senin çay*ın*
senin annne*n*
senin elma*n*

# Belonging to Me

*benim* is me. We've been using it a lot, and changing the nounts without even realizing it!

benim yurdu*m*
benim elma*m*
benim baba*m*
benim annem

# Belonging to Us
Let's just try to guess it! Yep, *bizim*. The noun endıngs are dıfferent.

bizim annemiz
bizim babamiz
bizim çay
bizim elmamiz
